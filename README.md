# Bamazon_MySQL
This Amazon-like storefront, called Bamazon will be implementing MySQL. In this application, products are stored with product name, department name, price, and stock quantity attributes. Bamazon will perform a read and update query upon request to retrieve all items and items' attributes using Node.js as well as updating the database when user purchases an item. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.
